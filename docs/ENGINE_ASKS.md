# What the daemon needs from the `tailscale-rs` engine

This lists the changes the downstream daemon (`tailscaled-rs`) needs from the `tailscale-rs`
library to unblock end-to-end features. Each ask is self-contained, additive, and
backward-compatible. Verified against the pinned engine rev `afa970c` (released `v0.6.6`).

Ranked by leverage: #1 converts ~115 lines of already-written, CI-built, feature-gated daemon code
into a working feature with a one-line change downstream.

## 1. (BLOCKER) Re-export `TransportMode` and `TunConfig` from the crate facade

**Why:** The daemon has the entire TUN-mode data path plumbed (prefs → wire → CLI `--tun/--no-tun`
→ `tun` cargo feature → root preflight), and the engine's `tun` feature compiles. The one missing
piece: a downstream crate that depends only on `tailscale` **cannot construct** the value to select
TUN, because the type isn't re-exported.

- `Config.transport_mode: ts_control::TransportMode` is **public** (`src/config.rs:174`), but
- the facade (`src/lib.rs`) does **not** `pub use` `TransportMode`/`TunConfig`, and `ts_control` is
  not a direct dependency of downstream crates — so `TransportMode::Tun(TunConfig { name, mtu })` is
  unnameable downstream.

**Ask (one line, in `src/lib.rs` next to the other `pub use ts_control::{…}` re-exports):**

```rust
pub use ts_control::{TransportMode, TunConfig};
```

`TransportMode` (enum: `Netstack` default, `Tun(TunConfig)`) and `TunConfig { name: Option<String>,
mtu: Option<u16> }` are already `pub` in `ts_control::config` — this only surfaces them through the
facade.

**Optional ergonomic extra (nice, not required):** a builder on `Config`:

```rust
impl Config {
    /// Select the kernel-TUN transport. `name` = desired interface (None → OS picks), `mtu` = None
    /// uses the transport default (overlay MTU 1280).
    pub fn use_tun(&mut self, name: Option<String>, mtu: Option<u16>) {
        self.transport_mode = TransportMode::Tun(TunConfig { name, mtu });
    }
}
```

**Downstream effect once landed:** the daemon's `build_config()` replaces its "TUN not yet wirable"
error with `config.transport_mode = TransportMode::Tun(TunConfig { name: self.prefs.tun_name.clone(),
mtu: self.prefs.tun_mtu })` — a one-line change — and `tsd-tth` (TUN data path) ships.

## 2. Accept `Option<secrecy::SecretString>` for the pre-auth key on `Device::new`

**Why:** The daemon holds the pre-auth key as `secrecy::SecretString` end-to-end (zeroized on drop,
never logged) and is forced to `.expose_secret().to_string()` into a plain `String` for the last
inch — `Device::new(&Config, auth_key: Option<String>)`. That plaintext `String` then lives,
un-zeroized, inside the engine (`Config.auth_key` and the resolve path). It defeats the daemon's
secret hygiene at the boundary.

**Ask:** offer a secret-typed entry point. Either:
- add `secrecy` as a dep and change the signature to `auth_key: Option<secrecy::SecretString>`
  (breaking — bump minor), **or** (back-compat preferred)
- add an alternative constructor, e.g.
  `Device::new_with_secret(config: &Config, auth_key: Option<secrecy::SecretString>)`, and have the
  existing `new` wrap a `String` into a `SecretString` internally.

Engine does not currently depend on `secrecy` (verified). Tracks downstream bead `tsd-tnv`.

---

## 3. Zeroize-on-drop for the private-key types

**Why:** `MachinePrivateKey` / `NodePrivateKey` / `DiscoPrivateKey` (and the WG static / PSK) derive
`Copy` with **no `Drop`/`Zeroize`** (`ts_keys/src/macros.rs:7` etc.), so key bytes are bit-copied on
every read and never wiped — despite `PersistState` docs implying zeroize-on-drop. A VPN's key
material should not linger in freed heap.

**Ask:** drop `Copy` on the private-key newtypes and add `zeroize::ZeroizeOnDrop` (keep the
`zerocopy` derives for the wire representation, but gate raw-byte access behind an explicit
`expose`/`as_bytes` method rather than free `Copy`). This is a security-hardening change; it will
ripple through call sites that rely on `Copy`. Tracks downstream bead `tsd-c3d`.

---

## 4. (Lower priority) A network-change / rebind hook

**Why:** A real `tailscaled` re-binds sockets and re-derives endpoints on link change (Wi-Fi
switch, sleep/wake). The engine exposes no `rebind()` / link-change entry point the daemon can call,
so a Rust daemon is sluggish/broken across network changes on laptops (fine for a static cloud
node). Tracks downstream bead `tsd-94d`.

**Ask (either, whichever fits the engine's design):**
- a `Device::network_changed()` / `Device::rebind()` method the daemon can call when it detects a
  link change, **or**
- internal `netmon`-driven rebind inside the runtime so the daemon doesn't have to.

This one needs engine design input — listed for awareness, not as a precise patch.

---

## Already sufficient — no engine change needed (noted to avoid redundant asks)

- **Interactive login**: `DeviceState::NeedsLogin(url::Url)` + `Device::watch_state()` /
  `device_state()` are exposed and already used downstream. Done.
- **Terminal-failure surfacing**: `DeviceState::Failed(RegistrationError)` is exposed and
  `RegistrationError::is_permanent()` is **public** — the daemon can already distinguish a permanent
  failure (bad/expired key) from interactive-login. No engine change needed; this is downstream work
  (bead `tsd-bml`).
- **Status without blocking**: `device_state()` is a non-blocking `watch` borrow — sufficient. Done.

## Suggested PR shape for the engine

#1 alone (the two-name re-export) is a tiny, safe, immediately-useful PR — do that first; it unblocks
a shipped feature. #2 and #3 are security-hardening and warrant their own reviewed PRs. #4 needs
design discussion. After #1 lands and the engine cuts a release, the daemon bumps its pinned
`rev`/version and flips TUN on in one line.
